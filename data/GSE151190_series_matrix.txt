!Series_summary	"In this study, human isogenic model of juvenile onset PD caused by DNAJC6 mutation were made. Human ESCs edited using CRISPR-Cas9 to make deleterious DNAJC6 mutation was induced to human midbrain like organoid (hMLO) for studying the mechanism of DNAJC6 deleterious mutation in causing PD       "
